# Amplify-Project
Amplify is a Spotify companion app meant to give you insights into your listening and visualize your music. 
We're using Node.js, Angular, and Three.js to create this experience - hope you enjoy :)

##Structure
Here we have the master branch. In addition to this, each team member (Max, Jake, Zora, Ella, Parker) have their own branch in which they work.

##How to Run/Test
